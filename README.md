**Image Processing Techniques in OpenCV**

**Overview**


This repository contains Python scripts that demonstrate various image processing techniques using OpenCV. The tasks covered include converting images to grayscale, applying image transformations (such as translation, rotation, and resizing), detecting edges, and applying filters, among others. Each task is implemented with clear steps, and the results are visualized using Matplotlib.

**Requirements**

To run the scripts in this repository, you will need to have the following libraries installed:

**OpenCV**

**NumPy**

**Matplotlib**

**You can install these dependencies using pip:**



**pip install opencv-python numpy matplotlib**

**Usage**

Each task is contained within its own Python script. You can run any script individually to see the corresponding image processing operation:


**python Task1_GrayScaling_ColorChannelSeparation.py**

Make sure to update the image path in the scripts to point to your desired image file.


**Tasks Overview**

**Task 1:** Gray-scaling and Color Channel Separation: Convert an image to grayscale and visualize the individual RGB channels.

**Task 2:** Image Translation: Shift an image along the x and y axes.

**Task 3:** Image Rotation: Rotate an image by specified angles.

**Task 4:** Scaling and Resizing: Resize images using different interpolation methods.

**Task 5:** Image Blur: Apply Gaussian blur to reduce noise in images.

**Task 6:** Brightness and Contrast Adjustment: Adjust the brightness and contrast of an image.

**Task 7:** Crop a Specific Region: Crop a defined section of an image.

**Task 8:** Draw a Circle: Draw a circle on the image at specified coordinates.

**Task 9:** Canny Edge Detection: Perform edge detection using the Canny algorithm.

**Task 10:** Smart Surveillance System: A practical application simulating image processing for surveillance.

**Task 11:** Image Histogram Analysis: Analyze and visualize histograms for the image.

**Task 12:** Linear Spatial Filtering: Apply smoothing, sharpening, and edge detection filters.
